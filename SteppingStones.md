### In-Game Name:
##### Steps

### Description:
##### 2 columns of platforms going from the start line to the finish line. For each row of the column one platform will break when I player hits it and the other platform will be normal. All modifiers can be used for this minigame however, there will need to be specific maps made for this gamemode only (maybe rotation of 3 maps?). More platforms will spawn in the columns as more players are in the server. 

### Rules:
##### Players take turns jumping across the platforms where only a few will make it to the finish. So far all consumables will be allowed for this gamemode (potions, bombs, bat) to speed up gameplay and make people cross the map faster. If given the time, can set up a clock giving a countdown that would explode the remaining players after it runs out.

### Planned Props:
- Start and Finish Platform
- Individual platforms (some breakable some standard)
- Billboard Clock 
- Kill Floor (or have people fall into void)
