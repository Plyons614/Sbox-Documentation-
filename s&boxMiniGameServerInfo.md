# S&box MiniGame Server Specifications

> [Documentation Link](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/)

### Introduction

The server will be inspired by Mario Party, Pummel Party, Fall Guys, and most importantly Squid Game/Crab Game. 
- Planned to be played with 10-40+ people in it at any given time. Aimed to be chaotic fest with voice proximity chat and methods for users to mess with each other while the minigame is taking place. There will be 1 winner or survivor after each minigame is played and then move on to the next one with an overall scoreboard to show who is currently placed the highest. 
    - Might do normal generalized minigames or survival based minigames (avoid getting sucked up by a ufo, survive a tornado, etc.)
    - One big payout of premium currency is currently planned where normal gametime and winning smaller mini-games get users the free currency
    - Special minigames at the end of each rotation for special prizes


### User Capabilities
- The user will have the standard movements brought by sandbox with simple jumping and sliding. The user will also be able to punch other people pushing them backward. There will be pickup-able items on the ground the user can use to their benefit or detriment as well as consumables bought in the shop to take into the next minigame with them.
- The user will be able to trade items with other people and also be able to earn points through playing the game and premium points through winning the minigames. MIGHT set up an auction style of trading where VIPs/Premium members can auction off their items for others to bid on. 
    - Focus primarily on customization for the user with points, more on the **PointShop** section
- Depending on the minigame and modifier there may be more controls for the player to use during that time
- There is also a GUI Menu User's can access for other controls and information listed in the [Basics](SBOX-DOCUMENTATION/s&boxBasics.md) document.
