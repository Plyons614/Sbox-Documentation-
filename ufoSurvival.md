### In-Game Name:
##### UFO Assault

### Description:
##### The group of players run around an open area while a UFO searches for them in the amount of time given. When the UFO hovers over a person it starts sucking them up within the beam and once the player touches the UFO they disappear/die. There may be multiple UFO's depending on the number of players there are. Players may also hit each other, knocking the other back and baseball bats give a bigger boost to the knockback taken. The goal is for each player to try to hit the other into the UFO beam. 

### Rules:
##### All consumables and modifiers will be allowed on this minigame. Players run or hide while the UFO sucks them up.

### Planned Props:
- Baseball Bat
- UFO
- Empty Shacks

### Maps:
- 3 maps will be made by the time the game comes out.
- 2 of these maps will have players placed in the middle of a cornfield with crop circles. There will be empty shacks with bats in them that players can pick up as well. Players will all spawn inside the crop circle next to each other with the shacks more outward of the map.
- 1 of the maps will take place in a woods/forest setting with no-roof shacks containing bats in them. The UFOs will start from the outside of the map where the players will be spread out.
