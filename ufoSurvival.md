### In-Game Name:
##### UFO Assault

### Description:
##### The group of players run around an open area while a UFO searches for them in the amount of time given. When the UFO hovers over a person it starts sucking them up within the beam and once the player touches the UFO they disappear/die. There may be multiple UFO's depending on the number of players there are. Players may also hit each other, knocking the other back and baseball bats give a bigger boost to the knockback taken. The goal is for each player to try to hit the other into the UFO beam. Up to 42 players. Every 14 players there will be 1 UFO.
